Always remember - if you create a Model in models.py with foreign key constraints, django adds _id to the field name
Example : if you do category = models.ForeignKey(Category)
then you can refer it in two ways
i. by category 
ii. by category_id


When you set debug=False, allow the hosts - and then if 404 or anny error exist - then django auto render the
404.html or error_code.html file kept in the templates folder


See what is Context Processors - go to the blogs/context_processor.py and track the instructions
After that go to the views.py of root folder to see what changed (with respect to the categories variable)


When I added : /slug then anything after / will be treated as slug - even /register will think register as slug
So better design is to write : /blogs/slug


Django modal forms create a form based on the model field
See how to create model form

1. Create a forms.py in HDBlogs
2. We are using the default user model that comes from django.contrib.auth.models so import the User from it
3. Now create a class and extend it to the UserCreationForm (see import in forms.py)
4. After creating the form - tell it to the url that calls the form creation (here /register so inform views.register)
5. After that see register.html
6. To style the form - you can use bootstrap classes or the django crispy forms(best method is to google)
7. Let us see the django crispy methods
    i. pip install django-crispy-forms
    ii. inside INSTALLED_APPS register 'crispy_forms'
    iii. since we are using bootstrap, make a variable inside settings.py as : CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap4'
    iv. pip install crispy-bootstrap4 and register in INSTALLED_APPS as 'crispy_bootstrap4'
    v. load crispy in register.html by {% load crispy_forms_tags %}
    vi. {{ forms | crispy }}
