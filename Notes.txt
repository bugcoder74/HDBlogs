Always remember - if you create a Model in models.py with foreign key constraints, django adds _id to the field name
Example : if you do category = models.ForeignKey(Category)
then you can refer it in two ways
i. by category 
ii. by category_id


When you set debug=False, allow the hosts - and then if 404 or anny error exist - then django auto render the
404.html or error_code.html file kept in the templates folder


See what is Context Processors - go to the blogs/context_processor.py and track the instructions
After that go to the views.py of root folder to see what changed (with respect to the categories variable)
